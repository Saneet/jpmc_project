It is up to you to decide what additional information to display In order to prevent you from
running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:

## What is Important

1. Proper function – requirements met.
2. Well constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in
   the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah
   blah pattern blah blah )).
3. Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
4. Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.

## What is Less Important

1. UI design – generally, design is handled by a dedicated team in our group.
2. Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.

## Bonus Points!

* Unit Tests
* Good design (I know I said it was less important, but what I mean is I don't want a beautiful,
  poorly constructed app).
* Additional functionality – whatever you see fit.

NOTE: Make sure you are correctly handing any necessary permissions. NOTE: Please make sure you are
using Java. If you want to demonstrate the use of Kotlin, we'd rather you use a combination of both.
